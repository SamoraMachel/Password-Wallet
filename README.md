# Password-Wallet
<p>
This is a minified Qt application for keeping your passwords in 
one safe place. It provides encryption for your credentials.<br/> You 
don't have to worry any more remembering your passwords, all you'll 
have to remember is your login password and the app will do the 
rest of remebering for you. This is a safe way for creating strong passwords
for your accounts without minding if you'll forget them. <br/>
We're all humans and one of our greatest weakness is forgeting :blush:
</p>
